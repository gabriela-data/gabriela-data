# Gabriela Almeida - Java & Python Developer for Microservices

Hello! I'm **Gabriela Almeida**, a passionate developer focused on building efficient and scalable solutions. Currently, I‚Äôm enhancing my skills in **Java**, **Node.js**, and **Python** to create powerful microservices. I gained solid technical knowledge during my **Systems Development** course at **SENAI CETIND**, where I worked on various projects that showcase my ability to build innovative and practical systems.

## üîß Skills

- **Java**: Developing robust systems with a focus on RESTful APIs, system integration, and applying object-oriented design principles. Experience with frameworks like **Spring Boot** and **JPA**.
- **Node.js**: Building scalable and efficient microservices with **Node.js**, using **Express** to create APIs and integrating with SQL/NoSQL databases.
- **Python**: Developing scripts and microservices with **Python**, focusing on automation, data analysis, and API integrations. Experience with frameworks like **Flask** and **FastAPI**.

## üéì Experience

During my **Systems Development** course at **SENAI CETIND**, I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge in several practical projects, developing microservices and full systems following agile development practices and solid software architecture principles.

### üöÄ Projects

1. **[Java Project - Task Management API](https://github.com/gabriela-data/projeto-java)**  
   A **RESTful API** built in **Java** using **Spring Boot** to manage tasks, with features such as create, list, update, and delete tasks. The application follows a clean architecture and integrates with a relational database (MySQL).

2. **[Node.js Project - JWT Authentication System](https://github.com/gabriela-data/projeto-nodejs)**  
   A user authentication microservice developed with **Node.js** and **Express**, using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure authentication and authorization. This project was designed to be easily scalable and integrated with other systems.

3. **[Python Project - Sales Data Analyzer](https://github.com/gabriela-data/projeto-python)**  
   A **Python**-based data analysis system using the **pandas** library to process large sales datasets and generate detailed reports. The system also integrates with external APIs and includes graphical data visualizations.
